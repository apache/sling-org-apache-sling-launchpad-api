# Apache Sling Launchpad API

This module is part of the [Apache Sling](https://sling.apache.org) project.

This module contains the API exposed by the Launchpad to bundles within the embedded framework.
It is not intended to be installed as a bundle into an OSGi framework; merely used as a dependency
for bundles where access to the Launchpad environment is necessary.
